# Node Module with Unittests Template #

This repository provides scaffolding to promptly bootstrap writing your own node module with unittests.
The unittests are run both within node environment and on the browser (which can help you determine
if your code works as expected on different browsers). The unittests get full coverage reports.

You also get a fully automated document creation from source code, automatic updating of your final
module/library name and version in README.md, and an html version of your README.md file.

## Quick Start ##

Replace ./src/dummy.js with your own module code and ./test/unittests/ with your own unittest. Type
`grunt` and you will get tests running both under node environment and browsers, your documentation,
and your full fledged README.md and README.md.html files.

## README.md ##

README.md is recreated and overwritten when you run "replace:dist" step of your Grunfile.js.
"replace:dist" will take your README.md.template, and replace certain varibles and produce your
final README.md file.

## Scaffolding Explained ##

In this section, we describe what each file does in this template and how you can modify them to your needs.

```
#### ./.editorconfig

From their website, "EditorConfig is a file format and collection of text editor plugins for maintaining consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs." This file has a bunch of settings that various editors can read and adjust their behaviour accordingly. You can read more about it on [their website](http://editorconfig.org)

#### ./.flowconfig ####

Configuration file for flow type checker. Flow is a static type checker which is helpful in catching null dereferences and unintentional type conversions.
You can read more about it on [their website](http://flowtype.org).

#### ./.jscsrc ####

Configuration file for JSCS coding style checks. We use a modified version of Google JS coding style and full JSDoc3 checks.

#### ./.travis.yml ####

Wikipedia says "Travis CI is a FOSS, hosted, distributed continuous integration service used to build and test projects hosted at GitHub". I strongly recommend that you connect your node module to Travis-CI through Github to run continuous builds and integration tests.

The generator puts two links to your README.md.template file, one linking an image to a *hypothetical* Travis-CI build task under your own github name. The generator does NOT create this build task. You can sign up with [Travis-CI](http://travis-ci.org) to get this working. You can read more on [their website](http://travis-ci.org).

#### ./Gruntfile.js ####

This is where all the magic lives. Gruntfile.js describes all the tasks, and how they interact
with each other. It can run your tests, create browser version of your tests, run them in
the browser, create their coverage reports, create documentation, create your dynamically
generated README.md, and README.md.html files and create your final browserified library along
with its minimized version.

#### ./jsdoc.conf ####

JSDoc configuration file. You can modify this file to change the behaviour of JSDoc which is used to create
documentation from the source code.

#### ./package.json ####

NPM package.json file. You describe your module in this file. The values for 'name' and 'version' fromthis file are later used in producing README.md file.

#### ./README.md.template ####

This is "almost" your README.md file except you can replace text patterns dynamically during Grunt run.
In Grunt.js file, there is a step/task called "replace:dist" which will take this README.md.template,
replace text patterns you identify in the task with their produced values, and produce the README.md file.
This lets you for example dynamically add the version number to README.md file.

#### ./src/dummy.js ####

This file is an example file of your library/module. You can replace it with your own code.

#### ./src/web-data-connector-wrapper.js ####

This file is an entry point of your library/module. You can replace it with your own code.
Grunt.js file assumes that the entry point file to your library will be the same as the name
of your module. So, if your library is called 'web-data-connector-wrapper' in package.json
(refer to "name" field in package.json"), your entry point file should be named
web-data-connector-wrapper.js.

#### ./test/unittests/dummy-test.js ####

You can add multiple test files to ./test/unittests/ directory. You probably want to have as many test files
under this directory as your source js file under ./src directory. In other words, you want to have one to one
mapping to your src files. I suggest for good housekeeping, every single file here should test one and only
one js file under ./src.

#### ./test/unittests/web-data-connector-wrapper-test.js ####

This unittest file tests your ./src/web-data-connector-wrapper.js file.

#### ./test/index.html.template ####

This file is processed by "replace:browserified_tests_file" task to produce an index.html file.
"replace:browserified_tests_file" task writes the location of your browserified unittests into the
index.html.template to produce the final index.html file. This 'index.html' file is then used
by "mocha_phantomjs:all" task to run the browserified unittests.

## ./Gruntfile.js and Tasks ##

Gruntfile.js tasks are closely coupled. Please be careful when you change them.

#### browserify ####

Browserifies the library so that your library can run in a browser.

#### clean ####

 * **clean:dist**

 Deletes the minimized and unminimized final output files.

 * **clean: docs**

 Deletes the docs.

 * **clean:tests**

 Deletes the output of tests and browserified tests.

#### connect ####

Starts a basic web server.

#### flow ####

Runs Flow static type checker.

#### jscs ####

Runs the code through jscs for coding style checks. This uses a modified version of Google coding style.

#### jsdoc ####

Creates documentation from src files using jsdoc.

#### jshint ####

Runs the code through jshint.

#### markdown ####

Creates an html version of the README.md file called README.md.html.

#### mocha_phantomjs ####

Runs the browserified tests thru PhantomJS.

#### mochaTest ####

Runs the unittests.

#### replace ####

Replaces text patterns in (template) files.

 * **replace:browserified_test_file**

 Replaces text patterns in the index.html.template.

 * **replace:dist**

 Replaces text patterns in README.md.template.

#### uglify ####

Minimizes the output of browserified library/module.

## Custom Tasks ##

Gruntfile.js comes with a whole set of custom tasks.

#### browsertest ####

Runs 'clean:tests', 'jshint', 'jscs', 'flow', 'browserify', 'replace:browserified_tests_file', 'connect:server', 'mocha_phantomjs' respectively.

#### dist ####

Runs 'clean:dist', 'browserify', 'uglify' respectively.

#### docs ####

Runs 'clean:docs', 'replace:dist', 'markdown', 'jsdoc' respectively.

#### localtest ####

Runs 'clean:tests', 'jshint', 'jscs','flow', 'mochaTest' respectively.

#### test ####

Runs 'localtest', 'browsertest' respectively.

## Generated Files and Directories ##

When you run the Grunt tasks, this scaffolding generates a whole bunch of files. They are explained below.

#### ./docs/* ####

Generated by 'jsdoc' task. All documentation in the src files should follow jsdoc format so that
this task can produce all the documentation.

#### ./dist/* ####

Generated by browserify and uglify and will have your final minimized and unminimized library.

#### ./README.md ####

Dynamically generated README.md file from README.md.template.

#### ./README.md.html ####

Generated from README.md file.

#### ./test/output/browser_tests_results.txt ####

Test results from the browser run of the browserified unittests.

#### ./test/output/coveragereport.html ####

This is an important file. It tells you how much your unittests cover your code. I recommend you
to have full coverage at >98% as it will help you to catch bugs early on.

#### ./test/output/output.txt ####

Test results from the node run of the unittests.

## 'projectparams' section of Gruntfile.js ##

This section has all the parameters necessary to run the scaffolding correctly. You can change these parameters according to your project's specifics.

Description of the variables in projectparams:

* **banner_for_production:** The first line for both the browserified output file and the minimized version.
* **docs_dir:** (Generated) Directory for the docs.
